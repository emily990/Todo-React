h# Todo-React

Developed a complete Todo app using React Hooks (useState) for state management.

Designed reusable components (Addtask, Listtask, Todo) and maintained clean parent-child data flow using props.

Implemented dynamic task creation and deletion with a stable identifier system using crypto.randomUUID() to avoid key conflicts.

Ensured scalable UI by organizing CSS modularly and following component-based architecture.

Enhanced user experience with real-time updates and optimized rendering.
